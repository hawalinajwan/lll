 **IMPACT POLARISATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITMHS**

The polarisation of social media algorithms can have a significant impact on the mental health of generation Z (Gen Z). In this context, polarisation refers to the tendency of algorithms to expose social media users to content that aligns with their views or increases separation between groups with different views. Some of the possible impacts are:Algorithms that prioritise content based on prior preferences can create a filter bubble around users, where they are exposed primarily to views and opinions that already align with their 
beliefs. This can reduce the diversity of perspectives and ideologies. 

According to our discussion, social media algorithms, which selectively display content according to user preferences, effectively deepen confirmation bias. This creates an environment where individuals are more likely to accept information that confirms their own beliefs, inhibiting openness to alternative viewpoints. Additionally, the impact is felt on stress and anxiety levels, especially among Gen Z, who are often exposed to content that fuels conflict or disagreement. Social comparisons reinforced by algorithms can put pressure on self-image, leading to attempts to reach standards that are often unrealistic. Overexposure to harmful content, such as disinformation and hate, is a consequence of algorithms that prioritise engagement levels. All of these contribute to the development of suboptimal mental health. Lastly, reliance on online social validation is growing, creating a drive to seek recognition and attention through positive reactions to content promoted by algorithms. As a result, there is a need for concerted efforts to balance these negative impacts and encourage more responsible and inclusive use of social media. 

To address this negative impact, a concerted effort is needed from social media platforms, algorithm developers, parents, and parents. 
social media platforms, algorithm developers, parents and educators. Digital education, media literacy and mental health coaching can help Gen Z understand and manage the polarising impact of social media algorithms on their mental health. In addition, it is important to promote responsible and inclusive use of social media to create a more positive online environment.
