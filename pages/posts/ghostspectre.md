## Ghostspectre

Since using ghostspectre, my desktop's performance has significantly improved. The idle RAM usage, which was typically around 80%, has decreased to 40%. Additionally, when using the power saver mode, my battery now lasts 3 hours longer, whereas previously it would drain to 0% in just 1 hour. This is a truly remarkable change.
