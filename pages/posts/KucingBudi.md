## Budi


---


Budi, the ash-gray cat, captures attention with his unique habits. In just one word, we can describe this cat's behavior: 'outgoing.' Budi confidently displays a spirited and cheerful personality in every step he takes.

What makes Budi even more special is his unusual fondness for spicy food, particularly chili peppers. While cats are generally known for being selective eaters, Budi proudly showcases his unique culinary taste. Whenever there's a dish containing chili, a joyful expression lights up his face, and with enthusiasm, Budi readily indulges in the spicy treat.

Budi's uniqueness not only lies in his charming ash-gray fur but also in his courage to face the typically disliked spicy flavor, a trait uncommon in most pets. With an energetic personality and an odd palate, Budi serves as an example that uniqueness can be found even in our pets' everyday behaviors.
