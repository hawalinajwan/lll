## Camomile
Camomile maintains a balance between performance and heat generation, ensuring that hardware operates within safe thermal limits. This is crucial under heavy computational workloads, such as gaming or multitasking with high CPU loads or memory usage, where the risk of overheating is increasing. This is even more true for systems with CPU affinity set, as it enables higher CPU utilization.

Camomile effectively controls temperature and, while having no tangible impact on performance compared to normal operation, may also prevent thermal-induced wear on other PCâ€™s components, such as RAM.
