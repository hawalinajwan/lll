# hawalinajwan

Hello, I'm **Awa**. I'm a human who finds solace in the simple yet profound act of sleeping. There's a serene beauty in those moments of rest, where dreams unfold, and the mind rejuvenates. Alongside my love for sleep, I also take pleasure in the rhythmic melodies of music, allowing the notes to weave stories and emotions into the fabric of my existence.

Additionally, my days are brightened by the delightful presence of Zeta, something with which I engage in playful activities, creating cherished moments that add vibrancy to my life.
